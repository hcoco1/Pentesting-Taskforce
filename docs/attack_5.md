- Proactively patching software and systems, using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and auditing web applications in firewalls are key measures we take to secure against vulnerabilities.

- By implementing strong encryption, using HTTPS, TLS, and VPNs, and continuously monitoring sensitive data, we ensure protection against unauthorized interceptions on the network.

- For DoS Attack Mitigation, deploy load balancers, content delivery networks, and anti-DDoS services. Implement rate-limiting and redundant network infrastructure to manage traffic and maintain service availability.

- For Phishing and Social Engineering Defense, conduct regular security awareness training, periodic simulated phishing tests, and use advanced email filtering solutions to detect and block malicious emails.

- Ultimately, these strategies culminate the entire project effort, demonstrating a commitment to defending cybersecurity.
