## **Project title: Virtual Lab**

Titled "Virtual Lab," this project involves each team member focusing on different exploitation scenarios. Responsibilities include:

- Setting up individual VM or Vocareum machines.
- Installing the necessary software.
- Configuring initial settings to conduct specific network attacks.

### Team Responsibilities

**Attack 1: Ivan (üßëüèª‚Äçüíª ‚ò†Ô∏è) - Web Penetration Testing**  
I will conduct a comprehensive web penetration test using the Mr. Robot VM. Throughout this process, I will meticulously document each step, the findings, and the overall results. This website showcases the detailed methodology and outcomes of my penetration testing journey.

**Attack 2: Ozzy - MITM**  
Ozzy will focus on Man-In-The-Middle (MITM). This includes techniques such as ARP Spoofing, DNS Spoofing, and SSL Stripping. Ozzy will document these attacks, providing insights into the execution and impact of these tactics.

By working on these individual components, we aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of various network attacks and their implications. This collaborative effort will culminate in a well-rounded capstone project, demonstrating our collective skills and knowledge gained throughout the bootcamp.
