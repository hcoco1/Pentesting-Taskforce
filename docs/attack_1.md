## Introduction

### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive web penetration test using the Mr. Robot Virtual Machine, a well-known vulnerable environment designed for practicing penetration testing skills. This documentation will provide an overview of the penetration testing methodology, findings, and overall results.

### Overview of the Mr. Robot Virtual Machine

The Mr. Robot VM is a purposely built vulnerable environment that mirrors real-world scenarios. It is inspired by the TV series "Mr. Robot" and contains multiple vulnerabilities that can be exploited to practice and hone penetration testing skills.

### Importance of Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. It helps identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in a system before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Conducting regular penetration tests ensures the robustness of security measures and the protection of sensitive data.

### Exploit Process

The process begins by creating a controlled, isolated environment to ensure safe testing without affecting live systems. Network scanning tools like Nmap identify live hosts, open ports, and available services, providing a detailed map of the target network.

The next phase involves enumeration, utilizing tools such as Gobuster and Wappalyzer to brute-force directories and identify technologies used by the target WordPress site. This information is crucial for understanding the target's infrastructure. Vulnerabilities are then identified using Nmap scripts and Nikto, which scan for outdated software like old versions of WordPress and potential security issues such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting in web servers.

Brute-force attacks use Python scripts and Hydra to guess login credentials and identify weak passwords and access points. Finally, the guide explains how to achieve a reverse shell using a PHP script or Metasploit, enabling control over the target system. 


## Findings

The report revealed several critical vulnerabilities:

| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4       | 5          | Medium   | WordPress Themes             | Multiple themes including outdated versions                        | Update themes and remove unused ones                         |
| 7       | 5          | Low      | Directories/Files            | Various sensitive directories and files exposed                    | Restrict access to sensitive directories and files           |
| 3       | 6          | Medium   | WordPress Plugins            | Various plugins including outdated versions                        | Regularly update all plugins and monitor for vulnerabilities |
| 2       | 8          | High     | SSL Info                     | Missing security headers and outdated SSL configurations           | Update SSL/TLS settings and add security headers             |
| 5       | 8          | High     | Configuration Issues         | Missing security headers and outdated PHP version                  | Update server configurations and PHP version                 |
| 1       | 9          | High     | HTTP (80/tcp) - Apache HTTPD | Open ports 80 and 443 running Apache HTTPD, potential entry points | Ensure Apache is up-to-date and configure security headers   |
| 6       | 9          | Critical | Credentials Found            | Username and password retrieved (elliot/ER28-0652)                 | Change all passwords and review user access controls         |


1. Open Ports Running Outdated Apache HTTPD
   - Open ports can serve as entry points for attackers, and outdated Apache HTTPD versions may have known security vulnerabilities. These weaknesses can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code, compromising the server's security.

2. Missing Security Headers and Outdated SSL Configurations
   - Security headers protect against attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. Outdated SSL configurations can expose the system to man-in-the-middle attacks and other SSL/TLS vulnerabilities. Ensuring up-to-date SSL settings and security headers protects data integrity and confidentiality.

3. Outdated WordPress Plugins and Themes
   - Outdated plugins and themes are common vectors for exploitation, as they often contain unpatched vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these to access the WordPress site, deface it, or steal sensitive information. Regular updates and monitoring are essential to maintain site security.

4. Configuration Issues and Outdated PHP Version
   - Misconfigurations and outdated software versions can introduce security risks. An outdated PHP version might have unpatched vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Proper configuration management and regular updates are critical to securing the server environment.

5. Exposed Sensitive Directories and Files
   - Exposing sensitive directories and files can provide attackers valuable information about the system, such as configuration details or user credentials. Restricting access to these directories and files is necessary to prevent unauthorized access and information disclosure.

6. Retrieved Credentials
   - The retrieval of credentials (e.g., username and password) indicates weak password policies and potential vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism. Compromised credentials can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, emphasizing the need for strong, unique passwords and robust access controls.

## Recomendations 

The findings from the Mr. Robot Vulnhub Virtual Machine assessment highlight several critical vulnerabilities that pose significant security risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **Update and Patch Management:** Ensure that all software, including Apache HTTPD, WordPress, plugins, themes, and PHP, are regularly updated to the latest versions. Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities.

- **Implement Security Headers and Update SSL/TLS Configurations:** Configure appropriate security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) and update SSL/TLS settings to current best practices to protect against various web-based attacks.

- **Regular Security Audits and Monitoring:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential security issues. Implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

- **Strengthen Authentication Mechanisms:** Enforce strong password policies, including complex and unique passwords. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add a layer of security to user accounts.

- **Restrict Access to Sensitive Directories and Files:** Implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive directories and files. Regularly review and update access permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

- **Enhance Configuration Management:** Review and improve server configurations to minimize exposure to security risks. Ensure that all configurations align with industry best practices and security guidelines.

By addressing these recommendations, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture, protect against potential exploits, and maintain a robust and secure environment for their systems and applications.
