The fourth attack is creating a phishing email with the help of social engineering and a fake login page. Social Engineering is based on human interaction, where attackers use human emotions and tendencies against their victims. Phishing exploits are used to test employee vulnerability to fake/malicious emails. The steps are as follows:

- Carry out reconnaissance of a website to set up a fake login page and a target to get their credentials (i.e. GitHub)

- Open Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) by typing `settoolkit` in your terminal

- Enter `2` for Website Attack Vectors

- Enter `3` for Credential Harvester Attack Method

- Enter `2` for Site Cloner

- Enter your IP address for SET to send back the captured credentials to you

- Enter the URL of the website‚Äôs login page you are replicating (i.e., https://github.com/login)

- Copy your IP from the previous step and create a convincing email for your target, asking them to click on the hyperlink (your IP) and login (to the fake login page)

- Once the target logs into the fake page, SET will copy and display the target‚Äôs login credentials for you to use.
